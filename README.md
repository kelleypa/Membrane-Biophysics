# Martini Course-Grained Simulation
We calculate the trajectories of the atoms on the lipid molecules in a bilayer according to Newtonâ€™s laws in MD simulations. To allow the study of larger systems over longer timescales, we employed the CG Martini force field [http://cgmartini.nl/].

# Domain Determination Method
Lipids were assigned to PSM-rich/cholesterol-rich (raft-like) domains according to the density of their lateral distribution within the plane of each leaflet. The assignment was made by a sliding window method in which a window ~ 2.4 x 2.4 nm (containing on average 11 lipids) in size was tracked ~ 0.8 nm (average separation between lipid molecules) in each direction.30 A window for which the count of individual lipids exceeds the threshold for random mixing with >75% probability was designated PSM-rich/cholesterol-rich. Windows that do not satisfy this criterion were deemed to be homogeneously mixed (non-raft). The domain type for each ~ 0.8 x 0.8 nm2 area was assigned and tallied 9 separate times by the sliding window, and ultimately classified by majority vote. The lipids inside the area were correspondingly categorized.
